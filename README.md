### Problem Statement
Home Credit is looking for patterns in its data regarding the default risk of consumer loans. Conduct an analysis to surface any notable patterns related to default risk.

### Deliverables
A Jupyter Notebook containing:
- Imported data, including at least two DataFrames and at least one combination of DataFrames via methods such as joining.
- Functions for cleaning the data set, with explanations for how null values are being handled in each field.
- At least two visualizations accompanied by textual descriptions of the business insights they communicate.

## Technical Acceptance Criteria:
Frame 
- Develops well-informed, hypothesis-driven business questions for analysis.
- Demonstrates ability to iterate and refine business questions based on new insights.

Extract
- Selects data that is relevant to the hypothesis-driven business question(s). 
- Uses data extraction techniques and formatting appropriate for the selected data.

Wrangle/Prepare
- Implements data cleaning techniques such as removing duplicates and correcting erroneous values. 
- Organizes raw data into a workable, analytics-friendly format. 

Analyze
- Manipulates data for exploration, insight gathering, and analysis.
- Uses rationale for revising the original business question, collecting more data based on the initial analysis, or continuing on to interpretation. 

Interpret
- Creates appropriate visualizations that support the findings and insights. 
- Identifies key insights pertaining to the original business question(s).
- Incorporates results of the analysis to support decisions and recommendations. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- An open-source code editor such as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

1. Download and open your open-source code editor. 

2. Download John Bacolores_Home_Credit.ipynb file.

3. Upload John Bacolores_Home_Credit.ipynb file.

## Running the tests

Run all cells. Awaiting user commands in the final cell of the notebook. 

### Sample Tests

How to add a transaction: Press [a] to add a transaction

    [a] then "Enter"

Input the title of the transaction:

    Check from brother

What is the category:

    income or expense

Enter the amount:

    500

Input the date in mm/dd/yyyy format:

    08/29/2023

Returns to user input: 

    Press [a] to add a transaction, [b] to view the account balance, [v] to view all transactions, or [q] to quit.

## Deployment

N/A - can launch via Jupyter Notebook

### Post-MVP Goals:
- The program allows you to track multiple accounts
- The program can analyze profit and loss for a specific month or year
- The program can provide high-level stats, such as average transaction size
- The program can track and analyze transactions by specific customers or vendors
